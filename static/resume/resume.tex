% Statement
%

As a passionate and enthusiastic lover of all things electronic, mechanical and hackable; I have always shown deep interest in the way things work. I'm a software engineer primarily focusing on cloud technology, developer tools and data science.\newline{}

My primary skill is software engineering. During my university placement programme in 2016/2017 I worked at a data analysis startup company as a software engineer and cloud administrator solving analytical and engineering problems at scale in challenging, highly-secure, government environments. I also have experience in project management and leadership; using tools such as Git, GitHub and Atlassian suite to organise agile workflows in small teams.
