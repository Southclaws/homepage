# Expectation Driven Design

This is a user interface and interaction paradigm I developed while building
Scavenge and Survive. The core principle of this idea is that gameplay mechanics
should reflect what a person would expect to happen in reality. This reduces the
need for user interface elements and other things to tell the player how to do
something.

This isn't necessarily about direct "realism" in a design sense, though it can
tie quite nicely to [pseudo-realism](/games/pseudo-realism). In other words,
implementing the idea doesn't mean the game must be an Arma or a Gran Turismo.
It just means that thing react the way players would expect them to without any
prior knowledge.

For example, if a player picks up a screwdriver and a cell phone, the player
would expect to be able to use the screwdriver as a weapon but not the cell
phone. Screwdrivers are pointy but cell phones are fairly lightweight.

In the context of a survival game, this is important. When a game contains a
multitude of objects in the environment that can be picked up and wielded, even
an experienced player may not know the in-game attributes of every single
object. So if the player can simply use their experienced from real-life instead
of needing to rely on guides, wikis and in-game tooltips.
