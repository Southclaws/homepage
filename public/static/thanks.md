Thank you for your donation towards Scavenge and Survive!

This money goes towards services I pay for that aid the development of the
project as well as software and server funds.

It also goes towards coffee and snacks which fuel my programming powers!

Here's a silly looking dog to thank you some more:

At this time, there are no in-game rewards for donators but I might hook you up
with something if you ask me. It won't be anything crazy like a weapon
(remember, SS is not and never will be _pay-to-win_).
