# Resume

My resume written in LaTeX, compiled to PDF.

I once had an ancient .docx file for my résumé/CV but after discovering LaTeX I've decided this is a much nicer format. Not prone to weird formatting errors like MS Word is, easy to update simply with a text editor and very portable.

I used [Moderncv Casual](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/moderncv-casual) as a template, originally by Xavier Danaux and released under [LPPL v1.3c](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/).
