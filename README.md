# My Homepage

Created with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) for server-side rendering.

This is a minimal ReactJS-based site which pulls resume JSON-LD format data from a GitHub Gist document. This means the content of the site can be updated simply by editing a Gist page!

It's also Docker ready, I host basically everything in Docker nowadays and even though this is a simple site, I did the same for portability (in case I ever need to move to another server/VPS service). ❤️ to the [Zeit team](https://zeit.co/about) for making next.js so easy to get that set that up so quickly!

The design (css and layout) are copyright to me but feel free to take the code and build your own React+JSON-LD homepage!
