# My Homepage

[Click here!](https://www.southcla.ws)

My personal home page. Created with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and
[next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) for server-side rendering. There's nothing else really interesting about it
other than how it generates the content from [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) data while also injecting it into the
components in `<script>` tags to improve SEO and linkability.

It's also Docker ready, I host basically everything in Docker nowadays and even though this is a simple site, I did the
same for portability (in case I ever need to move to another server/VPS service). ❤️ to the
[Zeit team](https://zeit.co/about) for making next.js so easy to get that set that up so quickly!

## Copyright

The design (css and layout) are copyright to me and I'd prefer it stay unique and I'm sure you would also like a unique
and personal website. However, feel free to take the actual code and build your own React+JSON-LD homepage!
